# Studionet
We designed, deployed and evaluated the StudioNet platform: an online community for learning digital design tools and techniques. Existing research has highlighted the limitations of conventional learning management systems (LMS), with many of them arguing that there is too much emphasis on teacher-led instruction rather than student-led collaborative learning. StudioNet aims to leverage the network graph to facilitate the collaborative learning among students.

## Brief introduction
I contributed on this project from Aug 2016 to June 2017 when I was a research assistant in the Department of Architecture, School of Design and Environment. I worked with Prof. Patrick Janssen (the Principal Investigator). I am not contributing to this repository any more.
